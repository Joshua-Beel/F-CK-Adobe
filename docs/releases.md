# Installers and GitHub updates

Download the Windows x64 setup executable from https://github.com/Joshua-Beel/Smacrobat/releases/latest. Run it once; it installs for the current user and includes PDFium and its license notices. WebView2 is installed if needed, which requires internet access. The published 0.2.0 installer has no Windows publisher signature. Future release builds can use Azure publisher signing when the repository configuration is available. Tauri update signatures are separate and are enabled.

In the installed app, choose **Menu > Check for updates**. The dialog shows the installed version, newer release notes, and download progress. Installation requires a click and is disabled while any document has unsaved edits or an operation is running. The verified update starts the installer, closes the app, and relaunches it. Open documents are not automatically restored. Checks are manual; ordinary commits do not update installed apps.

The public update endpoint is `https://github.com/Joshua-Beel/Smacrobat/releases/latest/download/latest.json`. It contains the version, notes, Windows x64 installer URL, and detached signature. Update downloads use HTTPS and the Tauri plugin verifies signatures with the public key embedded in the installed application. Failed checks or downloads show an error and allow retry. Downgrades are not offered. The former repository endpoint currently redirects here; new builds use the canonical URL directly.

## Signing key

Store the private updater signing key outside Git and preserve a secure backup. Replacing or losing it prevents existing installations from accepting future updates. Never commit it or print it in logs. The public key lives in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.

Store the private key in the repository Actions secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`. Set `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` only when the chosen key is password-protected. Do not generate a replacement key for each release.

## Publish a new version

### Azure publisher signing setup

Set these repository Actions secrets for Azure publisher signing: `AZURE_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, and `AZURE_SIGNING_PROFILE`. For a local Azure-signed build, supply the same three names as environment variables before running `npm run installer -- -AzureSigning`. Do not put their values in tracked configuration or release notes.

The other repository Actions secrets are `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`. No credentials should be pasted into this document or a chat.

The release workflow installs pinned `artifact-signing-cli` 0.11.0 and invokes `npm run installer -- -AzureSigning`. The Tauri signing hook applies Azure Authenticode signatures during bundling, before the final installer receives its Tauri updater signature. It then requires valid timestamped publisher signatures on both the app executable and installer before generating the manifest or uploading assets. Missing configuration or invalid signatures fail the release; the workflow never falls back to unsigned publishing. Local `npm run installer` remains a development build without Azure publisher signing. See [Tauri's Azure signing integration](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/windows/#azure-artifact-signing).

Publish publisher signing as a new version; do not replace the already published 0.2.0 installer, because its Tauri signature and manifest identify those exact bytes. Version 0.2.6 is tagged and has a verified signed draft. Installation and upgrade checks remain pending.

### Release steps

1. Set the same new stable version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`; refresh both lockfiles. Update `docs/release-notes.md` and README recent changes.
2. Run `npm test`, `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `npm run installer`. The installer command uses the configured updater signing key and writes the setup executable, `.sig`, and `latest.json` into `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.
3. Commit, push, and tag that exact commit `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Push the tag. Once all signing secrets are configured, `.github/workflows/release.yml` tests, builds, signs, and creates a draft release. The workflow refuses tag/version mismatches and does not overwrite releases.
4. Install and exercise the draft installer. Publish the release when verified. Mark it as the latest stable release so installed apps see the new `latest.json`. Upload all three assets before publishing; never publish an incomplete manifest or replace an existing version's files.

Local fallback: use `gh release create` with the existing version tag, the three locally built assets, `--draft`, and `--notes-file docs/release-notes.md`. This needs no Actions secret. After testing, use `gh release edit vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH --draft=false --latest`.

The first 0.2.0 installer establishes the updater. Earlier development executables have no updater and must install this release manually. Installation replaces app files only; source PDFs remain outside the installation folder.

## Verification

The pre-rewrite `v0.2.5` tag started [GitHub Actions run 35250005735](https://github.com/Joshua-Beel/Smacrobat/actions/runs/35250005735). It stopped during npm tests because the clean runner had not fetched the locked Cargo registry required by offline dependency-notice checks. No native test, signing, installer creation, asset upload, or draft-release step ran, so no 0.2.5 signed artifact exists. Run 35250878119 completed before the privacy rewrite after adding the locked Windows registry fetch before the unchanged fail-closed offline check. The rewritten [`v0.2.6` tag](https://github.com/Joshua-Beel/Smacrobat/commit/8cf90166623857dddd3854ce769549da55f6f5c4) records the cleaned source history; its existing draft assets were not rebuilt or re-signed. Independent extraction verified all three draft assets, updater manifest URLs and signatures with negative controls, timestamped publisher signatures, 26 packaged resources, five exact MPL archives, and bundled notices. The installer SHA-256 is `ec47981b533fdf4eb00d9fe62e52edd7bc1ef160cda9c18d962f0e1f39dfe255`. The signed PDFium DLL’s raw SHA-256 is `54dacfbc896b381bc77b7aa4075481c9640a4c1598fd3469e2ef86c49560aad9`, distinct from its pinned unsigned input `79d4676b656cfb1abcea88f9ade3b4b0826c5200382db5f4ec72a636c598c118` only because signing changes the PE checksum and security-directory fields and appends an aligned certificate; byte comparison rejects other changes. This is an unpublished draft; native save dialogs, installation, upgrade, and relaunch remain separate desktop checks.

The 0.2.4 draft passed GitHub Actions run 35184652612. Its downloaded installer and extracted application both passed a local timestamped publisher-signature check. Installer SHA-256: `cf97903897c10f0f02c31bc61f9ac9d929a9c5abdc116dc200cce01a4cd68c7a`, matching the GitHub asset digest. All three release assets are present. Installation, search UI behavior, and the end-to-end upgrade remain pending because desktop capture/input is unreliable; do not treat the draft as a verified published release.

v0.2.0 was installed successfully, and its bundled sample rendered in the installed application. The live GitHub manifest was fetched and its installer downloaded; SHA-256 matched the locally tested build (`17788cb82bb42deac35ea197a385a9bafc8cd331422446a2b834e115a90c4d2e`). The installed updater checked the public endpoint and correctly reported no newer version. Eleven frontend/release tests and seven native tests pass, including unsaved-edit blocking and mocked network/signature failures. Those tests also pass after the 0.2.1 version change. A full newer-version replacement/relaunch and the GitHub-hosted signing workflow still need verification.
